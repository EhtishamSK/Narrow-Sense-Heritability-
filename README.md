This R script performs genetic analysis using SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) data from a panel of 75 genotypes, aiming to estimate genetic variance components, including both additive and dominance variances, as well as narrow-sense heritability for multiple traits. The analysis begins by importing SNP genotype data in HamMap format, alongside phenotypic data. The genotype data is converted from character format to numeric codes, and genetic relationship matrices (GRM) are computed for additive, dominance, and epistatic effects using the rrBLUP package.

Mixed model analysis is conducted using the sommer package to estimate variance components for each trait in the dataset. The script provides estimates of additive and dominance genetic variances, residual variances, and heritability for all traits in the dataset. The results are stored in a data frame and can be easily exported as a CSV file. This workflow offers a detailed and flexible approach for understanding the genetic architecture of complex traits in a diverse panel of genotypes
